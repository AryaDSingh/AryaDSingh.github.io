                  JavaScript code that aims to create an animated space image using HTML5 and the 2D rendering context.
                  Most aspects of the project are randomly generated, resulting in a different scene during runtime.
                  Uses Global Alpha to control the opacity of various elements, allowing for fading and transparency effects.
                  Uses an animation loop to continuously update the canvas to create dynamic effects.
